/**
 * Thrown when a recoverable PDU decoding error occurs.  A recoverable PDU
 * error includes the partially decoded PDU in order to generate a negative
 * acknowledgement response (if needed).
 *
 * A good example is that the PDU header was read, but the body of the PDU
 * failed to parse correctly.
 *
 * The recommended action for "recoverable" errors is to return a NACK.
