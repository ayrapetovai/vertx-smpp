/**
 * Thrown when an unrecoverable PDU decoding error occurs. A good example is
 * a PDU length that is so large its signed negative (31st bit is 1).  This is
 * an impossible error and likely means something is drastically wrong with
 * the sequence of bytes.
 *
 * Another example is an invalid sequence number in an invalid range.  If
 * an invalid sequenceNumber is used, the recommended action is to close the
 * session.
 * 
 * The recommended action for an unrecoverable error is to close the SMPP 
 * connection.
