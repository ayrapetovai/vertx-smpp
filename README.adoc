== TODO
- Implement onChannelClosed in session which must be called on network connection reset by netty. Whit method must invalidate all requests in window with error *onChannelClosed*.
- Refactor package names.
- Implement metrics for Server, Client, Session in the most vertx-friendly way.
- Request expiry houdl not corrupt othe requests in channel (not knowing is it so or not in an AS IS code).
- Implement request.createGenarickNack() next to the request.createResponse() operation.
- Implement Outbind?
- Implement JMX?
- Make sequenceNumber of generic_nack could be null or introduce a field with will say was it null or just 0.
- Client and Server config should have an ability to be updated in runtime.
- Chaos testing: make a docker-image with echo-server and use on it `pumba netem --duration 60s --tc-image giadocker/iproute2 delay --destribution pareto --time 1000 --jetter 500 my-container-with-smmpp-echo-server`
- Find out how to scale client and server or several threads and connection such a way they would not lose performance.
- Reference and utility implementations:
    * (utility) testcontainers analogue for smpp-server with scenarios.
    * (reference) smpp-client and server with non-event-loop-threads.
    * (utility) ismpp, interactive smpp-client with interactive shell.
    * (reference) simple-smpp-server, able to send deliver_sm to RECEIVER session and client with TRANSMITTER and RECEIVER sessions.
    * (reference) email gateway, smpp -> EG -> smtp
    * (utility) smpp multiplexer, {smpp_1, smpp_2, ..., smpp_n} -> smpp-mux -> smpp-server
    * (utility) smpp-server-mock, can play scenarios.
    * (utility) smpp-client-mock, can play scenarios.

== Client Features
. [v] Bind to MC as `Transmitter`, `Receiver`, `Tranceiver` by calling bind method and pass host and port to it.
    .. [v] User can send `SystemId`, `Password`, `SystemType`, `Address` in bind_request.
    .. [v] Also, library sends interface version in bind_request.
. [0] User can set timeouts for operations *bind(...)*, *send(...)*, *close(...)*:
    .. [0] User can specify bind timeout in *bind(...) method call or by setting option 'requestExpiryTimeout', bind request in this case.
    .. [-] User can specify timeout for *close(...)* operation on client. Which handicapped time for client to close all sessions.
    .. [-] User can specify timeout for *close(...)* operation on session. Which handicapped time for session to wait for window to be drained, for `unbind` to send and for `unbid_resp` to be received all together.
    .. [v] User can specify 'offerTimeout' for *send(...)* operation, which is desired duration of waiting on window to abele to take the request. If widow continues to be full during all the waiting time, the send future will be failed with *onWindowTimeout* callback call.
. [v] User can send requests `submit_sm`, `deliver_sm`, `query_sm`, `data_sm`, `enquire_link` and [-] `generic_nack` as response. But user cannot send, `bind_receiver`, `bind_trancriver`, `bind_transmitter`, `unbind` and corresponding responses.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onSuccess*, which will be called when request will be answered with corresponding response or `generic_nack`.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onFailure*, which is called if any of send error event happened.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onDiscard*, which is called on session close, if option 'discardAllOnUnbind' is set to *true*. There is no guarantees that request was not sent on network connection, nor response was not arrived at network connection.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onWriteFailed*, which is called if netty cannot write request to a session channel.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onTimeout*, which is called if request was successfully offered to the session window and sent over the network connection, but response was not received in desired time duration set in option 'requestExpiryTimeout'.
    .. [-] For send future user can assign a callback *onChannelClosed*, which is called when connection is reset or if it was reset on the moment user code did a *send(...)* operation.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onWindowTimeout*, which is called when request is expired in window, that means that request was sent over the network connection but ro response was received until the duration ends, that was set in option 'requestExpiryTimeout'.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onWrongOperation*, which is called if session state is not suitable for request type.
    .. [v] For send future user can assign a callback *onNackked*, which is called if the `generic_nack` pdu was received as a response, and it's sequence number corresponds to the sequence number of the request.
    .. [-] User can use all vertx native API for send future, as that *compose(...)* and so on.
. [-] Server keeps track of metrics for all sessions, which are available to user.
. [0] User can unbind session by calling *close(...)* method.
    .. [-] User can specify timeout for session to close.
    .. [v] User can specify whether they want closing routing to await for window to be drained and send or they want window to be discarded on session close.

== Server Features
. [-] Each session keeps track of metrics, which are available to user.

== Usage
Client and server user code manages session object by their self's.

Jmv argument for ssl debugging `-Djavax.net.debug=ssl`.
